# ComputorV1

Write a program that solves a polynomial equation of degree less than or equal to 2. You will need to display at least:
- The reduced form of the equation.
- The degree of the equation.
- Its solution(s), as well as the sign of the discriminant when it makes sense

## Prerequisites
- Sbt and Scala needs to be installed

## How to run program
- Create a .jar executable: `sbt package`
- Run example: `scala [.jar] "5 * X^0 + 4 * X^1 - 9.3 * X^2 = 1 * X^0"`
